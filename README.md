# Flash-Card-Utility-106
A flash card utility for SI 106 Winter 2015
Welcome to the Flash Card Utility!

Programming Language: Python



Our Flash Card utility should be able to make and store flash cards as well as quiz the user.




Brainstorming ideas for how to implement and what we want to do:

Most likely we will use dictionarys to hold groups of flash cards for a specific topic or class
We could also create a class for the sets of flashcards 


Needed functiions/code:
class definition for flashcards
way for the user to input their flashcards
a way for the user to save thier flahscards
